/*
A Cruise_ship has the capability to automatically visit all of the islands. When 
it arrives at an island, it docks, and then it stays for a few updates. On the 
first one, it attempts to refuel from the island. On the next update it does 
nothing while the passengers see the local sights. On the third update, it sets 
course for its next destination (the closest unvisited island; in case of a tie, 
the first in alphabetical order). When it has visited the last island, it returns 
to the first island, the one it was originally sent to.
